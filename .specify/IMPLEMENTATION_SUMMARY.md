<questionaire-container>
  <div>Slide 1</div>
  <div>Slide 2</div>
  <div>Slide 3</div>
</questionaire-container>

<script>
  const container = document.querySelector('questionaire-container');
  container.next();      // Go to next slide
  container.previous();  // Go to previous slide
  container.goToSlide(2); // Jump to slide 3 (index 2)
</script>
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### View Example
Open `examples/carousel-example.html` in a web browser to see the component in action.

## Technical Specifications Met

✅ Acts as a carousel showing one child at a time
✅ Provides navigation methods (next, previous, goToSlide)
✅ Emits events on slide changes
✅ Prevents navigation beyond boundaries
✅ Works with any child elements
✅ Uses Web Components standard
✅ Fully tested and documented

## Task Completed  
✅ **feature/answer**: Implement `<questionaire-question-answer>` element

### Implementation Details

#### Core Component (`src/questionaire-question-answer.js`)
- Built using Lit web components framework
- Simple container element with additional properties/attributes
- Uses Shadow DOM with slots for content projection
- Implements complex value/text content relationship as specified

#### API Surface
**Properties:**
- `selected` - Boolean property reflecting selection state (reflects to attribute)
- `value` - String property for submission values with special behavior

**Attributes:**
- `selected` - Present when element is selected (no value, just presence)
- `value` - Optional attribute for submission value

#### Special Value Behavior (Per Spec)
- If `value` attribute is NOT set: `value` property returns current text content
- If `value` attribute IS set: `value` property returns attribute value
- Programmatically setting `value` property only affects attribute, not text content
- Text content changes don't automatically update `value` if attribute is set
- Handles null/undefined text content gracefully (returns empty string)

#### Example Usage
```html
<!-- Value will be the text content "Never" -->
<questionaire-question-answer>Never</questionaire-question-answer>

<!-- Value will be "year" regardless of text content -->
<questionaire-question-answer value="year">Once or more per year</questionaire-question-answer>

<!-- Can be selected -->
<questionaire-question-answer selected>Selected option</questionaire-question-answer>
```
