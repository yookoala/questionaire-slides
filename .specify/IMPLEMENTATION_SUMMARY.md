# Implementation Summary: Questionaire Container Carousel

## Task Completed
✅ **feature/carousel**: Implement `<questionaire-container>` as an HTML carousel

## Implementation Details

### What Was Built

#### 1. Core Component (`src/questionaire-container.js`)
- Built using Lit web components framework
- Implements carousel functionality to show one child element at a time
- Uses Shadow DOM with slots for content projection
- CSS-based hiding/showing of slides

#### 2. API Surface
**Properties:**
- `currentIndex` - Tracks the currently displayed slide (Number, starts at 0)

**Methods:**
- `next()` - Navigate to the next slide (doesn't go beyond last slide)
- `previous()` - Navigate to the previous slide (doesn't go below index 0)
- `goToSlide(index)` - Jump to a specific slide by index
- `slideCount` - Getter that returns the total number of slides

**Events:**
- `slide-changed` - Custom event emitted when navigation occurs
  - `detail.index` - Contains the new slide index

#### 3. Example HTML (`examples/carousel-example.html`)
- Demonstrates basic usage of the component
- Shows how to use navigation methods
- Includes event listener example
- Provides visual feedback with prev/next buttons

#### 4. Test Suite
- **simple-test.js** - Node.js-based unit tests for component structure and API
- **questionaire-container.test.html** - Browser-based visual test runner with UI feedback
- **functional-test.js** - Template for JSDOM-based functional tests (optional)
- All tests passing ✅

#### 5. Documentation
- **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation with:
  - Project structure overview
  - Component usage guide with code examples
  - Installation and testing instructions

  <div>Slide 2</div>
  <div>Slide 3</div>
</questionaire-container>

<script>
  const container = document.querySelector('questionaire-container');
  container.next();      // Go to next slide
  container.previous();  // Go to previous slide
  container.goToSlide(2); // Jump to slide 3 (index 2)
</script>
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### View Example
Open `examples/carousel-example.html` in a web browser to see the component in action.

## Technical Specifications Met

✅ Acts as a carousel showing one child at a time
✅ Provides navigation methods (next, previous, goToSlide)
✅ Emits events on slide changes
✅ Prevents navigation beyond boundaries
✅ Works with any child elements
✅ Uses Web Components standard
✅ Fully tested and documented

## Task Completed  
✅ **feature/answer**: Implement `<questionaire-question-answer>` element

### Implementation Details

#### Core Component (`src/questionaire-question-answer.js`)
- Built using Lit web components framework
- Simple container element with additional properties/attributes
- Uses Shadow DOM with slots for content projection
- Implements complex value/text content relationship as specified

#### API Surface
**Properties:**
- `selected` - Boolean property reflecting selection state (reflects to attribute)
- `value` - String property for submission values with special behavior

**Attributes:**
- `selected` - Present when element is selected (no value, just presence)
- `value` - Optional attribute for submission value

#### Special Value Behavior (Per Spec)
- If `value` attribute is NOT set: `value` property returns current text content
- If `value` attribute IS set: `value` property returns attribute value
- Programmatically setting `value` property only affects attribute, not text content
- Text content changes don't automatically update `value` if attribute is set
- Handles null/undefined text content gracefully (returns empty string)

#### Example Usage
```html
<!-- Value will be the text content "Never" -->
<questionaire-question-answer>Never</questionaire-question-answer>

<!-- Value will be "year" regardless of text content -->
<questionaire-question-answer value="year">Once or more per year</questionaire-question-answer>

<!-- Can be selected -->
<questionaire-question-answer selected>Selected option</questionaire-question-answer>
```

- ✅ Selected state management works properly
- ✅ Attribute reflection working correctly
- ✅ Edge cases handled (null text content, etc.)

## All Current Tasks Complete

Both features from TASKS.md are now implemented:
1. ✅ **feature/carousel**: `<questionaire-container>` carousel component  
2. ✅ **feature/answer**: `<questionaire-question-answer>` element

The project now has a complete foundation for building questionnaires with selectable answers in a carousel format.

## Current Task: feature/question-and-answer
✅ **COMPLETED**: Implement `<questionaire-question>` logics with only `<questionaire-question-answer>` in it

### Phase 1: Example and Test Creation ✅
- Created `examples/question-example.html` - Interactive example showing both single-select and multi-select question behavior
- Created `test/questionaire-question.test.html` - Comprehensive test suite covering all specified functionality
- Tests cover: component instantiation, single/multi-select modes, value property behavior, event dispatching, selection management

### Phase 2: Implementation ✅
- Implemented `src/questionaire-question.js` component according to specification
- Features implemented:
  - ✅ Single-select mode (default) and multi-select mode via `multiselect` attribute
  - ✅ `value` property returns string (single-select) or array (multi-select) based on selected answers
  - ✅ Returns `undefined` for single-select with no selection, empty array for multi-select with no selection
  - ✅ Enforces single-selection rule in single-select mode (deselects others when one is selected)
  - ✅ Allows multiple selections in multi-select mode
  - ✅ Dispatches "question:changed" events when answers are selected with `detail.element` pointing to the answer
  - ✅ Uses mutation observers to monitor answer selection changes
  - ✅ Properly finds and manages questionaire-question-answer child elements

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation ✅
- Updated `test/simple-test.js` to include questionaire-question component tests
- All tests passing (15/15) ✅
- Fixed shadow root access issue for graceful handling before component initialization
- Verified example HTML loads correctly and would work in browser
- Component properly integrates with existing questionaire-question-answer elements

## Current Task: feature/question-content-and-answer

- Examples demonstrate: single content with single-select, content with multi-select, multiple content elements per question

### Phase 2: Implementation ✅
- Implemented `src/questionaire-question-content.js` component according to specification
- Features implemented:
  - ✅ Simple container component for displaying question text or HTML content
  - ✅ Uses Shadow DOM with slots for content projection
  - ✅ Supports any HTML content (text, formatting, images, etc.)
  - ✅ Does not interfere with existing question logic
  - ✅ Can be used multiple times within a single question
  - ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing `questionaire-question` component

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation ✅

## All Current Implemented Tasks

Current status of TASKS.md:
1. ✅ **feature/carousel**: `<questionaire-container>` carousel component  
2. ✅ **feature/answer**: `<questionaire-question-answer>` element
3. ✅ **feature/question-and-answer**: `<questionaire-question>` with only answer elements
4. ✅ **feature/question-content-and-answer**: `<questionaire-question>` with both content and answer elements
5. ✅ **feature/question-container--getcontents**: `<questionaire-container>` getContents method

🔄 **NEXT**: 
6. **feature/question-container--values**: `<questionaire-container>` values readonly property

## Current Task: feature/question-container--values
🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: Implement the `<questionaire-container>` values readonly property

### Phase 1: Example and Test Creation ✅
- Created `examples/container-values-example.html` - Interactive example showing questionnaire container with values property
- Created `test/questionaire-container-values.test.html` - Comprehensive test suite for values property
- Tests cover: named vs unnamed questions, empty names, single/multi-select handling, sequential order, dynamic updates, empty selections
- Examples demonstrate: complete survey with named/unnamed questions, values aggregation, integration with existing methods

### Next Phase: Implementation
- Implement `values` readonly property in existing `src/questionaire-container.js` component
- Property should aggregate all children `<questionaire-question>` elements with non-empty "name" attribute
- Should build key-value object with "name" as keys and question `.value` property as values
- Should preserve sequential DOM order of questions
- Should handle single-select (string/undefined) and multi-select (array) values appropriately

The project now has a complete questionnaire system with content extraction capabilities and is ready for the final values aggregation feature.
